# Walmart Sales Data Analysis

## About

This project is dedicated to examining Walmart's sales data to identify top-performing branches and products, analyze the sales trends of various products, and understand customer behavior. The primary objective is to explore avenues for improving and optimizing sales strategies. The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from the [Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting).

"In this recruitment challenge, participants receive historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores across various regions. Each store encompasses multiple departments, and the task involves forecasting sales for each department within each store. Additionally, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset, posing a challenge as these markdowns can influence sales, yet predicting their impact on specific departments and the degree of influence is difficult."

## Approach Used

1. **Data Wrangling:** In the first step, data inspection was performed to detect **NULL** values and missing values, and data replacement methods were used to replace any missing or **NULL** values found.

2. **Feature Engineering:** This process helped us generate new columns from existing ones. Added new columns to analyze sales trends: `time_of_day` categorized sales into Morning, Afternoon, and Evening, `day_name` extracted days of the week (Mon-Fri) for branch activity analysis, and `month_name` captured transaction months (Jan-Mar) for peak sales insights. These enhancements aided strategic decision-making.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploratory data analysis was conducted to address the project's listed questions and objectives.
